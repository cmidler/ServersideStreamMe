   <!--It's a good idea to provide an RSS feed of privacy policy updates so that users don't have to keep checking back to see if anything has changed. Especially if your feed doesn't change regularly, it doesn't take much work to update it by hand whenever you make a change. Of course, whenever you make a large change, it's still a good idea to push a notice out to your users, even if you do have an RSS feed. Make sure to remove the RSS section below if you don't use an update feed.-->

     <h1 id="personal-info">Personal info</h1>
        <p>whoYu only collects the information we need to provide the service our users want, and NOTHING else. When you sign up for whoYu, we collect your unique device identifier (UDID), and your zip code. This allows whoYu to ensure our service is released in areas our users want it and to allow our app to funtion properly. The vast majority of the information pulled from facebook, that the user can view/edit/remove from her/his profile, is stored locally on that user's device and is never sent to our company.<p>

     <h1 id="collection">How we collect info</h1>
        <p>whoYu only collects a user's email address, unique device identifier (UDID) and zip code upon registration. Once connected with a thrid party social network, whoYu pulls pertinent profile information into the user's device's local cache. This is NOT sent to our company, but instead is intended to ease the effort of setup on our users. The limited amount of user data we do collect, is kept fully encrypted and secure throughout the process of sending, storing and deletion. </p>

      <h2 id="collection_tracking">Tracking technologies</h2>
        <p> No tracking technologies are utilized by whoYu. whoYu is able to give users access to other users within 100ft of her/him by utilizing BTLE technology that comes from your device. GPS and all other location positioning systems are not necessary.<p>
